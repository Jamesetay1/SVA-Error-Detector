According to the essay Encouraging Results of iPad Study, Woyke (n.d.) pointed that a test group gave a good result of use iPad in study. This device can help student in reading articles and it can  gives  useful tools which books can not and makes classes interesting. Students do not need to take heavy books with them, But it may  has  diffcults in highlight text. Loop (n.d.) told us some disadvantages of using iPad in school. Students need to know how to use an iPad which will  spent  times. And an iPad is not cheap and students may use it to play games or listen music.   As new technology come to people's life, there is a debate that students can use iPads to help them outweigh their challenges. Some people believe that iPads can help students and iPads should be use in classrooms. Other think that iPads are not good in help students to overcome their challenges. I hold a view that benefits of iPads in school classroom outweigh their challenges. There are two reasons.   First of all, iPads are powerful tool to help people in many ways. They are lighter than laptops and people do not need to carry chargers all day. According to Woyke (n.d.), a test group in the University of Notre Dame   use  (⅔) iPads as a part of a year-long study of e-readers and test group had high satisfaction with iPads. This device can not only help people in daily life but also in study. Woyke (n.d.) said students also believe they can  reading  the articles assigned for the course and do not need to print them on paper. This means iPads are environment friendly. They can help people save papers. Students do not need to carry lots of books which are really heavy.  Another reason is iPads are a useful tool to help student to study. They can keep articles organized and can help student find them easily.   All in all, iPads are good for student use in classrooms. They are lighter and easy to use I believe the iPads can help student success in their classes.  First author think that Ipad in classroom   have  (⅔) advantage for students to be more encourage in classroom or to study. They also use it for reading instead of printing which is easier and help them to read on more additional topics. However, first author also believe that Ipad could give advantage like distracting students. Additionally, authors from text two agree that using Ipad in classroom would be disadvantage such as not every students know how to use Ipad and it would be watse of time for professors to teach them how to use it when they can work on other things that give more advantage on study. It's also  cost  alot of money to buy Ipad.

Whether or not that the benefits of using iPad in classroom help students to study harder or better?

Is using Ipad in class help you for study? Are you using it for work or playing game?

Research from many university show that students work better in class with pen and paper.  It's also cost you more money to have tablet or Ipad with your phone and your laptop. Form text Disadvantages of Using iPad for school have  mention  that many students still don't know how to use this technology and it's would be waste of time to teach them, when you can spend more time on studying.   Using iPad in classroom can also be distracting because of most student use it for playing game or match other things.   However, from the result of University of Notre Dame giving out iPad for students to use in class professors found out that their students are more encourage to study. They use iPad for many advantage for example read notes on iPad instead of printing them out. They study more and read more additional topics.   From not printing out paper to read actually   help      them to save more environment. Also some people work more better with their iPad than with writing paper because they have many technology to help them.   In the end, I believe that have to be the one who decide what they want not the professors or schools. They have to choose whatever works best for them, because it is their life and their education.      Robots are a electronics devise by human. it does not have any mind or feeling. Human can process them and order them, they will do the tasks exactly same as human's order. but something they did better even than people. Like machine product, explore universe and some more.
First of all, I want to talk about robots begin instead of people work in factory. From objectly way, I think that robots could finish the tasks more efficiently well. they could save time, that also means they can get more benefits. Because the robots are mindless, controlled by people. Last time I went to Japan. My father brings me to a cargo factory. I saw that robots instead people are doing the translation, they did real good and fast, but this is also a big social problem, that is people can't get a job. By the robots development, I think that this problem should be attentive by our government.
Secondly, we can use robots to explore universe. As human, we   knows that the universe is endless, we may can not find a boundary of universe forever. So, the universe is mystery, horror, dangerous place. people may die in the universe, because there doesn't have oxygen. But it's not difficult for a robots. they   doesn't need oxygen to maintain they activities. they just need battery. robots aren't a life. so, robots can instead of people to explore the universal plants, As I know, America just send a scrafspace to Mars to explore.
Robots could used by a tool. A more convenient tool for human. they could make life more easily and comfortable. But there still a line that is do not depends on robots to solve anything it will change our social system.

The world is evolving at a high pace & the 21st century can be entirely digitizes. Not only in the way of social websites, but also in banking [1 word unclear], transportation & various things which we cannot even think also. As research  suggests that thousands of students are going in the field of computer science. Management information system; electric mechanic & computer engineering there is a possibility that the world can get bully digital because of several work jobs in this numerous fields.

From my perspective, people in future has to spend their time wisely on social media because looking on the facts there would is tons of information on social media that might take several years to look at it.   Distraction; its a word that can change your life from who you were & who you are and that's affects on social media as well. There  are  many disleading information on social wasting your time. Being at that point average people spend around 6 hours on their mobile phone itself. People are getting falsified by giving wrong information on social media.

At last, I would rest my words that time management would be a key role on social media also getting the information correct & not to be distracted on social media. Moreover, focus on what you planned for the day, or a week in a month that can key for from distraction. Thus, social media is a very good communication to interact with people but on the other side see its cons also.
