4788	So at this point , what should this child do ?
19487	There are many good things in Parks library .
19678	That is truly inspires me .
16941	As for these problems , the following statement could well illustrate my point .
11371	Many demographers suggest that the labor force reduces incredibly .
19777	After correct this test , he got an entire understand about my math .
17460	My classmates so love these games .
11665	The first kind of people is the group of the left-behind .
10297	I was born in Guangzhou and lived there for eighteen years , so you can find many traits of Guangzhou citizen from me .
10015	Until now , I was grown up with seeing my role models .
14490	As previously stated , the reason why people come here to build and make it better is that they want to be successful .
8910	My native city Liuhou is located in the north central part of Guang Xi and it is an extraordinary important city in Guang Xi because of its multicultural .
16755	Love is always a beautiful memory for everyone .
6323	The example of good environment is nice landscape outside of the company building , the office is neat and in order , and the other workers are easy to be working with .
8855	There are people want to get money and others ' property in illegal ways , and there will be accidents happen without expectation .
5984	And it turned to that whatever they did , could cause a strong effect on me .
13521	The other drawback is there is a lot of unhealthy information online .
5064	Beauty has different way to show us , maybe is a picture , may be us a movie or sometimes is a TV show .
5722	However , nowdays , youngster would direspect the elderly by playing pranks on them and which cause the eldery to suffer minor injuries that would be fatal due to their age .
14492	For example , when I was young , I met a staff member who worked in a restaurant that my family always visited .
15499	However , people in America just start studying hard when they get into colleges .
3560	Form my prospective , I believe that mining is a good selling way because It saves consumers time , it help them make better choices , and because it saves suppliers budget .
18349	First , I have to do exercise and adapt to the temperature of the water .
9138	For instance , in South Korea , the most significant social issue through out the year has been the National Secretary Group using the twitter bot to spread the rumor of the politician to win the election .

12519	Unfortunately , they did not have high salary , so they really had a hard time .
19365	But if you ask me what do i usually do during my relaxing time , i can tell you i like listening to the music especially country music .

19535	Here are my reasons .
9798	Finally , the Greek government promises to make some change .
10488	In contrast , try to think the days now we have : We work whole day and get back to home from work , and we bring the fresh food out from the fridge and put it into the microwave oven .
12750	By this I mean , workplaces necessitate that people from both sex work and get educated separately .
